# Resources packs 
This is still Minecraft. 

You can install [Faithful 32x] if 16 pixels isn't enough for your fancy tastes.
Add [eating animations](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/32x-eating-animation), [bushy leaves](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/bushy-leaves-for-faithful-32x) and [AppleSkin's addon](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithful-32x-appleskin-addon) for even more 32x goodness. 

# Shaders
You'll need Iris in order for Shaders to work. You will be prompted for it when you [install](server/setup) the modpack. 

Here are a few you can use: 
- For beefy rigs: [Rethinking Voxels](https://modrinth.com/shader/rethinking-voxels)
- [Photon Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/photon-shader) *(There are currently a few bugs but hey, [FAFO](http://fafo.urbanup.com/17618639).)*
- [BSL Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/bsl-shaders)
