If you already have a setup for your configuration, you can follow these steps to import them into a new instance. You may have to follow those steps whenever you update, or when you install a new season of the server. 

<Aside type="caution" title="Compatibility notice">
Note that config files may not be compatible between different versions of the modpack.
If such a file is incompatible, you can always remove it from the `.minecraft` and it will replace itself when launching the game.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. Locate the `.config.txt` file. 
It will usually be located under the root file of your `.minecraft` folder. 
To access it from the Prism Launcher, select your old instance and click on 'Folder' on the right sidebar. 

2. Back up the `.config.txt` file in a safe location.
The desktop will do fine. 

3. Update/Install your instance of the game

4. Paste the `.config.txt` file.
